It's nice ðŸ¤¨ to have a look at [**periodic table**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table) to identify [crazy people ðŸ¤– ðŸ‘¾ ðŸ˜¼ ðŸ¤ª ðŸ¤¡](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(character)) at [workplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace) who bring their idioms ABC from movies gradually as their dirty langauage AKA bullying, gossips, sexuall harassments, stubidity, peeing on themselves ðŸ’©, ... etc.

`FYI:` Those crazy people, have no mother or father to raise them in a good way, so you can consider them as [uncontacted-people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples). Be cautious ðŸ›¡ âš  for your health.
