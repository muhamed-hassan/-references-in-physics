It's nice ðŸ¤¨ to have a look at [**periodic table**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table) to identify [crazy people ðŸ¤– ðŸ‘¾ ðŸ˜¼ ðŸ¤ª ðŸ¤¡](https://github.com/muhamed-hassan/production_deployment_syndrome/wiki/Bad-examples-of-parents) at [workplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace) who bring their idioms ABC from movies gradually as their dirty langauage AKA bullying, gossips, sexual harassments, stubidity, peeing on themselves ðŸ’©, ... etc.

`FYI:` Those crazy people, have no [mother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother) or [father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father) to raise them in a good way, so you can consider them as [uncontacted-people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples). Be cautious ðŸ›¡ âš  for your health because they're always cross the [personal boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_law) of others under the fake cover of [socialization ðŸ¤¡ ðŸŽ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immature_personality_disorder). Also they're the result of [ILLEGAL-MARRIAGE](https://github.com/muhamed-hassan/production_deployment_syndrome/wiki/Illegal-Marriage#illegal-marriage--) which we're fighting globally because it's considered a crime that destroys our society.
